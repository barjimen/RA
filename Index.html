                    <p>
                        In place of a standard accolade-touting career biography,
                        the top right corner of Helena Hauff's SoundCloud page reads:
                        "Helena Hauff! Du rufst an, ich leg auf." The German phrase
                        is a shrewd double entendre that makes use of auflegen's two
                        meanings—"to DJ" and "to hang up." Call Helena and she'll play
                        for you. Or, maybe more likely, she'll just put down the phone.
                        When I asked her about it over a coffee one crisp afternoon in early September,
                        she laughed and said she thought it was funny and rhymed with her stage name.
                        But more than a joke, the shibboleth is reflective of an irreverent worldview that's
                        led to the Hamburg DJ's intrigue and anomalous staying power after more than a decade
                        of above-ground success: authentic and steadfast, she refuses to answer to trends or
                        the industry's sometimes crippling pressures to conform.

                    <p>Now a flag bearer for the lo-fi electro leanings associated with Bunker Records and go-for-broke
                        '90s warehouse raves, Hauff has become the ambassador for a suite of retro, underground sounds
                        while
                        still achieving commercial appeal. That she has been playing such large-scale events as
                        Awakenings,
                        Gottwood, Primavera and countless major clubs around the world for years is a feat amid the
                        choices
                        she's made to run counter to the mainstream. A vinyl-only DJ with no manager, press campaigns,
                        social
                        media account or even a smartphone, she has defied the unwritten laws that govern the modern
                        music
                        industry, which privilege artists who satisfy the demands of algorithmic populism and the
                        Instagram
                        economy. More than a decade into her career, Hauff—who is celebrating her third BBC Radio 1
                        residency
                        and a release on London's fabric Originals this month—has competed with and even surpassed many
                        of her
                        contemporaries, remaining relevant in spite of, or even because of, her outsider approach to
                        music for
                        music's sake.</p>

                    <p>Slight and lean with a tangle of brown hair, Hauff is charmingly self-effacing in discussing her
                        explosive ascent.
                        "I don't think that much about it," she told me, coolly rolling up the sleeves of a
                        loose-fitting denim suit.
                        "I don't have a plan. I never had a plan. How the hell I ended up getting the bookings I have
                        now... I don't know how it happened."</p>

                    <p>Though flippant, Hauff partially attributes her success to her abiding commitment to the tastes
                        she honed as a university student in Hamburg.
                        Bred on a musical diet of The Stooges and Loop, she was sonically primed for the strobe-lit
                        intensity of DIY electronica, which she recalls
                        first randomly picking up at a record store when she was 18. She quickly grew fond of Dutch
                        artists like Guy Tavares and I-F, who have notably
                        not changed their squelching school of acid and electro in the 30 years since they first started
                        throwing parties. It wasn't long before she
                        started collecting similar records and DJing, and then holding a Tuesday night residency at the
                        vaunted local haunt Golden Pudel, at which
                        she invited Tavares and I-F to play.</p>

    <section class="text-center">
        <p><b style="font-size: 30px;">Golden Pudel's</b> understated anarchist ideology resonated with Hauff as she
            began hosting her own nights and cultivating a hometown following.
            "I realised pretty quickly that the people surrounding the Pudel were pretty politically involved," she told
            the Guardian in 2018.
            <b>"Not like a political party, but a kind of anti-capitalist idea."</b>
        </p>
        <br>
        <p>Hauff's affinity towards the club's punk-minded ethos blossomed in tandem with her escalating focus on
            production and record digging,
            which became an obsession to the point that she dropped out of school to pursue music full-time. At first
            her focus was on her studio.
            She used (and continues to work from) an all-hardware setup, whose immediacy and limitations allowed her to
            elicit the cantankerous sounds
            being circulated by some electro pioneers in The Hague. Some of her earliest releases from this period, like
            Return To Disorder, which became
            the name of her record label, are particularly raw. The tracks, which straddle electro and subversive
            hardcore, rarely peak and rarely resolve,
            deploying mincing synths and washes of static that chew up the ear. To her, the style looked towards the
            future while remaining rooted in a lineage
            of protest music that soundtracked Detroit's recent past.

                Said her close friend and collaborator L.F.T., an electro DJ and producer from Hamburg, told me over the
                phone.
                "She knows exactly which track is on each record—she has an almost photographic memory and knows what
                will fit into each other."
                Having played back-to-back with her a handful of times, including a hugely popular 2020 set on Berlin's
                HÖR, he said she exudes
                extreme calm behind the decks, and has an uncanny ability to mix any two records together perfectly in
                less than five seconds.
                "She knows what will happen before it happens," he said. "It's pretty special."
            </p>
            <br>
            <br>
            <p>
                I spoke to Hauff about how she honed her technique, inquiring specifically about whether or not she
                wrote notes on her record sleeves,
                as many vinyl DJs do as cues for themselves in the club. She said no. Instead, she has a special type of
                synesthesia that allows her to
                "see" songs. "Quite often I play a record, and I don't know what the hell it is or what the artist is
                called, but I can see the structure
                in my head," she said. The anatomy of each track resembles a complex "anti-clockwise clock" where
                different parts of the song form structures
                that imprint themselves in her mind's eye immediately upon first listen. "I can see exactly how many
                bars are in a track, when a new element
                will start, where the hi-hats are," she added. As such, she doesn't require the screen of a CDJ, instead
                pulling from an extensive collection
                of rhythmically and stylistically diverse vinyl that she can methodically construct into seamless,
                genre-spanning sets.

                        Hauff is impressive behind the turntables. She's commanding and magnetic,
                        playing with a casualness that belies the rigor of mixing high-BPM records
                        for crowds of spiral-eyed partygoers in claustrophobic clubs. (Though she
                        told me that one turntable malfunction literally left her crying under
                        the DJ booth between mixes, she conceded that any slip-ups likely weren't
                        perceived by anyone but her). At Lyon festival Nuits Sonores in May,
                        I watched from La Sucrière's overhead mezzanine as she lissomely popped
                        records onto the turntables, pausing to leisurely hand roll cigarettes
                        and scan through her record bag while still engaging with a spellbound
                        throng of more than 2,000 people. The performance was exceptional to
                        say the least, securing my full and undivided attention in a way that few DJs still can.

                        "It creates a lot more energy [to play different genres]," she told me after the set.
                        "It's also a lot harder than playing just one thing. But when it goes well, it creates
                        this uniform sound over time. And if you listen to that for three or four hours, then
                        you can hear that it will make sense together—you'll see the big picture."

                        But it was at Hauff's much-anticipated Berghain appearance in September that she flaunted
                        the full range of her skills, showcasing how her curation, even more than her technical
                        panache, has secured her enduring popularity. In a venue whose bread and butter is the
                        knuckle-dragging routine of four-to-the-floor techno, her set was a refreshing landscape
                        of dynamic peaks and valleys. Troweling from a timeline of noisy, neo-gothic dance
                        music—curdling acid, full-pelt industrial, fanged electro—her selection harkened
                        at times to gritty '90s nostalgia and at others to mechanical futurism. It also
                        eschewed a set's traditional shape in which tensions climax and build. Her method
                        was to churn up themes, cycling fluidly between different strains of off-kilter
                        dance music played one after another. While this tactic could have come across
                        as eclectic at best (or abrupt at worst) in lesser hands, in Hauff's, the result
                        was to create less of a trajectory than an overall atmosphere.

                    <p>
                        Hauff uses this kind of strategic titration to gradually introduce niche genres to festival
                        audiences that might not be as attuned to underground dance music, playing one challenging
                        track deep into a mix after an hour of supple build-up. It's how she's managed to bridge
                        such disparate scenes and hold onto a broad listenership, accumulating followers who both
                        enjoy the shapeshifting backdrop of her dark selections and the effortlessness with which
                        she introduces styles that would otherwise feel out of context or beyond the norm. A friend
                        of mine who has historically favoured deconstructed club music and Hessle Audio-like bass
                        summarized Hauff's idiosyncratic, cross-genre allure well: "I usually hate electro," she
                        said. "But I love Helena Hauff."

            as a highly diverse, yet still aesthetically consistent, selector. When I asked the London
            label about their decision to work with her, they interestingly pointed to her DJ sets rather
            than her past releases."Helena was one of the first names on our list of artists we wanted
            to work with," Jorge Nieto, fabric's creative director, wrote over email. "She’s an excellent
            artist, always digging for new tracks, and her sets are always refreshing. She has a passion
            for records and the craft that wereally love at the label."

            Out now, Living With Ladybirds sits well on fabric Originals,
            which seems to highlight artists who are the torch bearers of
            their respective genres. The four tracks are true to her past
            work's spareand unarmoured grit. "Touching Plastic" offsets
            the electric thrum of hardware with scuzzy drums and a lone
            synthesizer, while "Your Turn To Fly" and the melodically
            comparable "Jonas" cull heavily from the sketchy single-take
            feel of her 2015 LP, A Tape. Despite the arc of Hauff's career
            since her last consistent string of releases before the pandemic,
            the overall impression is that she has remained resolutely committed
            to a prototypical sound—one she has unwittingly become the representative over the last few years.

        </p>
        <br>
        <h1>"I just go along with what's being presented to me. I never thought,
            'What am I going to do next?' <br> I know there are a lot of artists who have
            some kind of business plan, but I just never have.<br> I've never wanted to
            'reach goals.'"
        </h1>
        <br>
        <p>
            Part of Hauff's drawing power to a relatively above-ground audience is the distinct musical sensibility
            she's disseminated in her studio and behind the DJ booth. But it's also the subtle ways in which she courts
            intrigue by dodging conventions. Not only did she not approach fabric for Living With Ladybirds—they tapped
            her for songs last January, and have seemingly been the only purveyors of any kind of promotion—but she's
            allegedly never had any set ambitions for her music more generally. Opportunities have emerged in the wake
            of her exceptional talent.
        </p>
        <br>
        <p>
            "I just go along with what's being presented to me," she said at our second meeting. "I never thought, 'What
            am I going to do next?' I know there are a lot of artists who have some kind of business plan, but I just
            never have. I've never wanted to 'reach goals.'" The statement was less of a put-down than an admission of
            punk naivete where in her attention has been purely on the records and releases that interest her and
            nothing else.

                <p>In 2022, this audacity is rare and refreshing. The entrenched and extended power of social media has
                    fed
                    the majority of the arts—and nightlife as a microcosm of these wider commercial economies—into the
                    maw
                    of unfettered platform capitalism; understandably, many DJs and producers have been thrust towards
                    the
                    kind of shameless self-promotion and easily-digestible music-making that generates income by
                    gratifying
                    hungry Instagram scrollers and the companies that peddle products to them. What's more, many artists
                    used these networks to sustain wavering careers at the height of the pandemic. Wanting to stay
                    connected
                    to their fans and keep the attention of a dwindling (and increasingly competitive) cabal of clubs,
                    they
                    posted selfies and produced accessible tunes that could proliferate on algorithms and discovery
                    pages.
                    Some artists have been subject to criticism for ostensibly championing the love-and-acceptance
                    values
                    around club music while buckling to pursue commercial profit. There are plenty of artists who have
                    beefed up their feeds and pivoted their signature styles in accordance with bank-backed trends.</p>

                        Hauff is impressive behind the turntables. She's commanding and magnetic,
                        playing with a casualness that belies the rigor of mixing high-BPM records
                        for crowds of spiral-eyed partygoers in claustrophobic clubs. (Though she
                        told me that one turntable malfunction literally left her crying under
                        the DJ booth between mixes, she conceded that any slip-ups likely weren't
                        perceived by anyone but her). At Lyon festival Nuits Sonores in May,
                        I watched from La Sucrière's overhead mezzanine as she lissomely popped
                        records onto the turntables, pausing to leisurely hand roll cigarettes
                        and scan through her record bag while still engaging with a spellbound
                        throng of more than 2,000 people. The performance was exceptional to
                        say the least, securing my full and undivided attention in a way that few DJs still can.

                        "It creates a lot more energy [to play different genres]," she told me after the set.
                        "It's also a lot harder than playing just one thing. But when it goes well, it creates
                        this uniform sound over time. And if you listen to that for three or four hours, then
                        you can hear that it will make sense together—you'll see the big picture."

                        But it was at Hauff's much-anticipated Berghain appearance in September that she flaunted
                        the full range of her skills, showcasing how her curation, even more than her technical
                        panache, has secured her enduring popularity. In a venue whose bread and butter is the
                        knuckle-dragging routine of four-to-the-floor techno, her set was a refreshing landscape
                        of dynamic peaks and valleys. Troweling from a timeline of noisy, neo-gothic dance
                        music—curdling acid, full-pelt industrial, fanged electro—her selection harkened
                        at times to gritty '90s nostalgia and at others to mechanical futurism. It also
                        eschewed a set's traditional shape in which tensions climax and build. Her method
                        was to churn up themes, cycling fluidly between different strains of off-kilter
                        dance music played one after another. While this tactic could have come across
                        as eclectic at best (or abrupt at worst) in lesser hands, in Hauff's, the result
                        was to create less of a trajectory than an overall atmosphere.

            As with her DJing, Hauff has navigated her career by being impromptu and intuitive, letting the pieces fall
            into place. In the time since we spoke, Hauff started a month-long residency with BBC Radio 1. Her first
            hour-long mix is a high-octane trip through the recesses of her record collection, exploring hiss-laden
            industrial and electro. In between songs, she narrates her selections, detailing the memories that inspired
            some of her choices. The majority are timeless cuts she found when she was 18 that she's still playing now.
            "I randomly bought this in the mid-2000s," she wrote to me after the fact, citing Radioactive Man's
            "Uranium." "I remember thinking, 'This is the best thing I've ever heard in my life.' The core of the music
            has never changed. It's about that raw energy—it's what I've always been into."
